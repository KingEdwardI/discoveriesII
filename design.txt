we are going to need to read in a json file.
from that json we are going to build out an HTML page which will, in the end be converted into a PDF.
the orders will be organized by 'itemNum'. 
for each individual itemNum we will print an order page (half page), unless the item is a ring or bracelet. 
  if the item is a ring or bracelet, we will print each one individually
if the item 'attr' is unspecified, we will default to single-sided jewelery, which will print 8 across the page.
  if there are more than 8, we will break the line. after that line break, we will reprint the order description and continue printing the item orders
if the item 'attr' is 2-sided, we will print 4 across the page before breaking, reprinting, and continuing
if the item 'type' is a 'ring' or 'bracelet' then we will print an 'itemNum' for each order.

the order description matches the 'itemNum', for each order.
parts of the order description will be in the form of Arabic text images.
  we will need to load in those files for each order sent through.
  the Arabic text images should be added in on creation of the order description.
